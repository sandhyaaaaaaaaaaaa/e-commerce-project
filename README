# Product Catalog — Filter & Sort

A static, client-side product listing page that supports filtering by category and price, and sorting by rating (plus price and name). Works on GitHub Pages without any build step.

## Features
- Category filter (multiple selection)
- Price range filter (min/max)
- Sorting: rating, price, name
- Responsive grid
- No dependencies, pure HTML/CSS/JS

## Run locally
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
2. Serve the folder with any static server (recommended for consistent behavior):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (no build tools)
1. Create a new GitHub repository and push these files.
2. In your repo, go to Settings → Pages.
3. Under "Build and deployment", set:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`), folder `/ (root)`
4. Click Save. Your site will be live at the URL shown there (usually `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`).

This project includes a `.nojekyll` file so GitHub Pages serves assets without Jekyll processing.

## Customize
- Edit `script.js` to change the `PRODUCTS` array (name, category, price, rating, image).
- Styling is in `styles.css` and structure in `index.html`.
